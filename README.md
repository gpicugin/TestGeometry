## About The Project

Dll defines classes of curves, such as Circle, Ellipse and Helix and gives API to work with it.
Project main includes main.cpp, which code do next:
- creates two containers(to store Curves of all types and to store only Circles);
- fills 1st container with random generated Curves;
- saves to file Data.txt coordinates of points and derivatives of all curves in the 1st container at t=PI/4;
- copies all Circle pointers from 1st to 2nd container;
- sorts pointers via radii forn min to max;
- calculates sum of radii from 2nd container;
- print to console number of Circles and sum of their radii;

## Built With

This programm was written on MS Visual Studio 2019 using Windows SDK 10.0 and Platform Toolset v142 without pre-compiled headers.
The solution is on TestGeomery Folder.
Geometry folder contains source code of dll.
Main folder contains code using it to do a task from your letter.

## Usage

This source code may to use for build curves and tangents lines in definite point
